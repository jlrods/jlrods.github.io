                    As computing programming became a very important matter within José Leonardo's life (it
                    stopped from being just a hobby, but became his new passion instead), the necesity to get involved
                    into formal education was undeniable.<br />
                    The computer programming for beginers course offered by LCFE is considered as an itroduction to structured
                    programming by learning Java programming language and the use of Eclipse IDE.
